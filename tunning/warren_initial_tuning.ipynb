    "Creating an LLM requires massive amounts of data, significant computing resources, and specialized skills. On Vertex AI, tuning allows you to customize a foundation model for more specific tasks or knowledge domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the prompt design is excellent for quick experimentation, if training data is available, you can achieve higher quality by tuning the model. Tuning a model enables you to customize the model response based on examples of the task you want the model to perform.\n",

    "### Quota\n",
    "**important**: Tuning the text-bison@001  model uses the tpu-v3-8 training resources and the accompanying quotas from your Google Cloud project. Each project has a default quota of eight v3-8 cores, which allows for one to two concurrent tuning jobs. If you want to run more concurrent jobs you need to request additional quota via the [Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas)."
